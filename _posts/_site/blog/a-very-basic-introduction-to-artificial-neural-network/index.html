<p>Yesterday, I was considering going for <em>The Most Epic Action Movie Ever</em>. Since it was an action movie, I was up right away. A quick search online revealed it having good ratings. Thatâ€™s great! I called my friends, informed my plans and they jumped in. All boxes ticked, so I went.<br />
The decision process can be visualized as below.<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"></figure></p>

<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ANN_1-1024x910.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here is how I made the decision:<br />
Itâ€™s an action movie (+1 point) with a good rating (+1 point) and my friends are coming (+1 point). Total = +3<br />
Now, my decision parameter is if I get a total of 3 points then I will go, else I wonâ€™t.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(1) going if points = 3
(0) not going if points &lt; 3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is possible that I am ok with meeting just two of the criteria. In which case:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(1) going if points &gt;= 2
(0) not going if points &lt; 2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This decision parameter is called an <strong>activation function</strong>. I am going to represent activation function as the following from now on.</p>

<p>If I am limited by budget then,</p>

<p>Here, I have introduced a penalty. Suppose the movie tickets do not fit my budget but all else holds true. I will calculate my points as:</p>

<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Points_Calc-1024x256.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since 1 &lt; 2 I will not be going for the movie.<br />
These numbers on the edges between the nodes are called <strong>weights</strong>. So far I have covered weights and inputs. Letâ€™s try to write this in a generalized form.</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">x_1</script> denote rating input, <script type="math/tex">x_2</script> be action input and so on.<br />
Let <script type="math/tex">w_1</script> denote the weight between rating and output node. <script type="math/tex">w_2</script> between action and output and so on.<br />
The equation then becomes: <script type="math/tex">x_1 w_1 + x_2 w_2 + x_3 w_3 + x_4 w_4</script></p>

<p>This can be written as <script type="math/tex">\sum_{i=1} ^4 x_i w_i</script></p>

<p>Let f(x) be the activation function. Then the whole equation can be represented as: <script type="math/tex">f(\sum_{i=1} ^4 x_i w_i)</script></p>

<p>However, there is another term remaining called bias.<br />
<strong>Bias</strong> is essentailly another input which is always on (set to 1). It is used to shift the activation threshold.</p>

<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bias1-300x267.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 Going</strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bias2-300x267.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>-2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 Not going</strong></p>

<p>This can be interpreted as, if I am a movie buff I will go in any case. If however, I donâ€™ like movies, I wonâ€™t go at all. Now, these are the examples of two extreme cases but the idea that bias shifts the threshold of activation is clearly illustrated.<br />
The general function now becomes:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(\sum_{i=1} ^4 x_i w_i + b)</script>

<p><strong>General Architecture of Artificial Neuron</strong></p>

<p>This is the general architecture of an artificial neuron. There are many different architectures of artificial neural networks such as RNNs, Feed-forward and Convolutional NN. Even different varieties of activation functions haveâ€™t been explored. And, concepts such as back-propagation, momentum and dropouts havenâ€™t been touched. In the following posts, I am going to cover all these concepts.</p>
