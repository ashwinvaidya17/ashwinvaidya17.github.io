It’s the small things like having the proper racket preparation. Ensuring that you go back to the T after your shot. And, keeping an eye on the opponent to see what they are doing and where they are.</p>
<p>Recently I participated in a tournament and saw a player give a tough fight to his opponent who was a more experienced player. This player did the basics right. He went to the T after his shot and always kept an eye on the experienced player. While he ended up losing, it was a very close match. This made me reflect over other games that I have seen. In many cases the players won not because they did something special but they did the basics right.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder, are there some basics in life we might be doing wrong.</p>
