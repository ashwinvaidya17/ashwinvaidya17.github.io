<p>Even my friend had created an <a href="https://github.com/adityauchiha/AnimeNotifier">amazing telegram</a> bot which sends a message when the latest episode of your favourite anime is released.</p>
<p>Inspired by his bot, I decided to make my own telegram bot.</p>
<p>I had then recently given my final university exams. The university releases provisional results online. As I wanted to create the bot, I decided why not a notifier bot which sends me a message when the latest results are uploaded instead me refreshing the website obsessively.</p>
<p>My first step was to track the changes on the website. Since the website was static, I decided to track the changes as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Save a copy of the page.</li>
<li>For every one minute, save another copy of the site.</li>
<li>See if there are any differences. If there are any, then print a message and update the original copy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yeah! I know, pinging every minute is too much but like I said, I was obsessed.</p>
<p>To test the code, I created a local page to track changes on. When I was satisfied with it, I decided to integrate it with telegram.</p>
<p>After searching online and consulting with my friend, I found out that to create a bot I needed to first get an API key. For that, all ones needs is to open a chat with Bot Father in Telegram.</p>
<p><img src="imgs/results-notifier-bot/bot_father.jpg" alt="" title="Getting API Key" /></p>
<p>Telegram provides a library to create a bot using python. It can be installed as follows.</p>
<p><code>pip install python-telegram-bot</code></p>
<p>I ran the sample code to check if it was working.</p>
<p>It worked! It was now time to integrate the two. Here, I faced a couple of roadblocks. I had two loops running: one for pinging the website and another that telegram uses for polling. That meant I needed a way to run both the loops in parallel. I decided to use <code>mutiprocessing</code> for running both the loops.</p>
<p>The start function would add a userâ€™s chat id to the list which would be later used to send message if any change in the website occurred.</p>
<p>Except! When I ran the code, It did not send any notification of an update. After spending <strong>quite</strong> some time debugging, I discovered a rookie mistake. I was using <code>multiprocessing</code> insetad of <code>multithreading</code> for running the loops. Each process has a different stack memory. So, a list made in one loop (running on a different process) cannot be accessed from another loop. Hence, I had to switch from multiprocessing to multithreading because threads share the same address space.</p>
<p>Finally, after ironing out the wrinkles I deployed it on Heroku. And it worked!........for a day. It sent updates of the results uploaded for that day but then stopped sending any update. This took me a couple of days to figure out why.</p>
<p>Again, an avoidable problem. Had I read the Heroku documentation I would have known that Heroku resets the applicaiton to its last commit once a day. This means that all variables in the memory and any files generated would be deleted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another note on not reading the documentation: Once I was done with the use of my bot I found out that even telegram provides presistent storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ðŸ¤·</p>
<p>The solution was to store and read from a presistant database. But I decided to just pickle my cchat id and the telegram group of my friends into a file and commit it.</p>
<p><em>Because hard-coding is too mainstream.</em></p>
<p>That way the chat ids would remain presistant.</p>
<p>Thats the story of my <em>very professional</em> telegram bot. Although, I did learn quite a lot from this project.</p>
