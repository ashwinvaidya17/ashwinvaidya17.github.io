<h1 id="what-is-artificial-intelligence">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>

<p>Artificial Intelligence! The solution to all our problems or our future overlords? Whichever side you are on, this article attempts to broadly explain what comprises artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>There are a lot of definitions for what artificial intelligence is but, for this discussion, I will define it as the study of <em>intelligent machines.</em></p>

<p>If you are a film/TV buff then AI may bring to mind images of R2D2 from Star Wars or HAL 9000 from 2001 Space Odyssey. However, AI need not be limited to robots with human-like intelligence. It can also be a software which performs a particular task; as seen on our smartphones, from maps which show us the shortest routes; or shopping/video apps which suggest products/movies based on our interests.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-does-one-define-ai">So, How Does One Define AI?</h2>

<p>Formally, it can be explained as the study of <em>intelligent agents</em> which perceive their <em>environment</em> and then take actions which maximize their chance of achieving their <em>goals</em>.</p>

<p>Consider the example of an autonomous car. Its <em>goal</em> is to drive from one location to another, while avoiding all obstructions in its route. Here, the car is an <em>intelligent agent</em> and its <em>environment</em> comprises the road and obstacles.</p>

<h2 id="what-characterises-an-intelligent-agent">What characterises An <em>Intelligent Agent</em>?</h2>

<p>An intelligent agent uses <em>sensors</em> to determine the state of its environment. In the example of the autonomous car,  cameras, RADARs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">LiDARs</a> etc, are the <em>sensors</em>. The agent then used its <em>knowledge</em> to decide the response and takes action using <em>actuators</em> (motors in case of the car) to interact with the environment. That is, move forward, apply breaks, take a left, etc.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-knowledge-of-the-ai-agent-come-from">Where Does The Knowledge of the AI Agent Come From?</h2>

<p>The most elementary AI systems have a <em>knowledge base</em> that comprises of explict, hard coded input-response pair rules. Such systems are also called as <em>Expert Systems</em>. Now, AI is transitioning towards an implicit representation of knowledge. These AI agents do not have input-response pair hardcoded but rather they figure out the response based on the data acquired by them during training. This is where Machine Learning and Deep Learning come in. I will explain both these terms in a different post.</p>

<p><em>If you want to read more on AI environments refer to <a href="https://ashwinvaidya.com/blog/posts/ai-environment-types">this post</a>.</em></p>

<p>Before I end this post, let me quickly explain a few more terms.</p>

<p><strong>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) -</strong> This is also referred to as  <em>weak intelligence</em>. This type of AI specializes in only <em>one area</em>. Route finding in Google Maps is an example of ANI. In fact, most of the AI we are surrounded by today fall into this category.</p>

<p><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) -</strong> This is also referred to as <em>strong intelligence.</em> This type of intelligence is human-level intelligence and is the goal of AI researchers. Such an AI is good at a diverse set of tasks, can comprehend complex ideas and learn from experience.</p>

<p><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) -</strong> This type of intelligence is far superior to that of humans.</p>
